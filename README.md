Welcome to the GitHub Repo for Common Lisp By Example, an introductory set of notes on Common Lisp. I hope you find it useful and it helps you learn Common Lisp. Star the repo if you like it :-)

The first edition of this guide is saved in the pdf file in this repo. I am now embarking on a second edition which will live entirely via markdown files. This repo is a work in progress until then.

## Medium Articles

I also blog on Medium at [https://ashok-khanna.medium.com](https://ashok-khanna.medium.com) and below are some of the articles I have published to date there. They are also part of the Common Lisp By Example Series.

1. [Lisp & the Web](https://ashok-khanna.medium.com/lisp-the-web-4c00c88d11f9): An introductory guide to creating web applications with Common Lisp & Google Compute Engine

2. [Persistent In-Memory Data Storage in Common Lisp (B.K.N.R)](https://ashok-khanna.medium.com/persistent-in-memory-data-storage-in-common-lisp-b-k-n-r-37f8ae76042f): A guide to the BKNR package and how to create a persistent data store that loads directly into Common Lisp. Very useful in my opinion.

3. [An Introduction to Lisp Packages](https://ashok-khanna.medium.com/an-introduction-to-lisp-packages-7a9ee352006e): An introduction to the Lisp package system, a useful read for intermediate programmers.

4. [A Guide to Formatting Lisp](https://ashok-khanna.medium.com/formatting-lisp-5e28020b8bac): An introduction to formatting and indentation, aimed at beginner Lisp programmers. I no longer follow some of the tips here, but I think it was a useful exercise for me when I started Lisp programming, so hopefully it will be a useful one for you too.

## Lisp Resources I find useful

Below are some useful Lisp links.

1. [Common Lisp the Language, 2nd Edition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html): The *de facto* textbook for Common Lisp, written by the Chairman of the ANSI Common Lisp Committee. Highly recommended.

2. [On Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html): The legendary book on lisp programming and macros by none other than Paul Graham, founder of the Y Combinator Venture Capital firm. Highly recommended. Don't read this until you have a reasonable amount of experience programming in Lisp!

3. [Common Lisp Cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/): The well maintained cookbook for Common Lisp. Contains recipes for many tasks you want to accomplish, however something to read after you get the basics of the language (in my opinion). Try contributing to it as well!

4. [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/): Quicklisp is the primary library manager for Common Lisp, an exceptionally useful tool for all Lisp programmers. For example, it allows you to set up a web server within 10 lines of code!
