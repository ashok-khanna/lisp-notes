<H2>Issue LOOP-FOR-AS-ON-TYPO Writeup</H2>

<PRE><B>Status:</B>         Proposal FIX-TYPO passed 12/91<P>
<B>Issue:</B>  	       <A HREF="iss221.htm">LOOP-FOR-AS-ON-TYPO</A><P>
Reference:      X3J13/89-004 page 2-10, CLtL/II page 721, and dict-flow.tex<P>
<B>Category:</B>       Clarify/fix-typo<P>
<B>Edit History:</B>   Version 1  20-Aug-91 by JonL <P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Problem Description:<P>
</B><P>
 From the draft proposal .tex file, under the subsection {\bf for-as-on-list},<P>
 the words:<P>
<P>
     In the {\it for-as-on-list\/} subclause,<P>
     the {\tt for\/} <P>
     or {\tt as\/} construct iterates over the contents of a <P>
     @type[list]. It checks for the<P>
     end of the @type[list] as if by using<P>
       @funref[endp].  <P>
<P>
 were erroneously copied verbatim from the subsection {\bf for-as-in-list},<P>
 rather than the intended wording from the Iteration Subcommittee.<P>
<P>
 At one level, this prescription doesn't make sense;  by saying that <P>
 it is iterating over the &quot;contents&quot;, rather than down the successive cdrs,<P>
 of the list, there is confusion about the values assumed by the variable<P>
 [which is subsequently said to take on the &quot;tails&quot; of the list.]<P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1988, the Iteration Subcommittee suggested a change from<P>
 the then existing practice of terminating both LOOP-FOR-AS-IN and <P>
 LOOP-FOR-AS-ON by simply a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_null.htm#null"><B>NULL</B></A> test.  [Indeed, in the MacLisp days before<P>
 CommonLisp, <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_endp.htm#endp"><B>ENDP</B></A> didn't exist; and the common use of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_null.htm#null"><B>NULL</B></A> rather than <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_atom.htm#atom"><B>ATOM</B></A><P>
 was based on a performance hack for the PDP10 Architecture.]  So <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_endp.htm#endp"><B>ENDP</B></A> was <P>
 specified for LOOP-FOR-AS-IN because that style views the list as a sequence <P>
 having &quot;contents&quot; or elements; but <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_atom.htm#atom"><B>ATOM</B></A> was specified for LOOP-FOR-AS-ON<P>
 since the only concern was the succession of list tails.  The LOOP-FOR-AS-ON<P>
 case is intended to be more general -- and hence have a less restrictive<P>
 termination test -- so that user-defined iteration over non-standard<P>
 lists can be supported.  But the current draft specification completely<P>
 and accidentally defeats this design.<P>
<P>
<P>
Proposal (<A HREF="iss221.htm">LOOP-FOR-AS-ON-TYPO:FIX-TYPO</A>)<P>
<P>
 Restore the original wording as intended by the Iteration Subcommittee<P>
 as follows:<P>
<P>
    In the {\it for-as-on-list\/} subclause,<P>
    the {\tt for\/} <P>
    or {\tt as\/} construct iterates over a<P>
    @type[list]. It checks for the<P>
    end of the @type[list] as if by using<P>
      @funref[atom].  <P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Editorial Impact:<P>
</B><P>
 Very small.<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
 The evidence that this is a typo is in the Lucid Product Documentation<P>
 of about the same time that 89-004 was abstracted from it; this product<P>
 documentation has the &quot;correct&quot; wording, and the person responsible for<P>
 doing the abstracting simply copied over the wrong, albeit very<P>
 similarly worded paragraph.  The two paragraphs are close together<P>
 in that text.<P>
<P>
 Without this fix, there will surely be gratuitous variations as to<P>
 how the termination testing is done for the LOOP-FOR-AS-ON case.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
 Some existing implementations still adhere to the MacLisp inspired<P>
 version that used to be distributed from MIT, which simply used <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_null.htm#null"><B>NULL</B></A><P>
 for both the FOR-AS-IN and the FOR-AS-ON cases; some adhere to a<P>
 later Common Lisp version that uses <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_endp.htm#endp"><B>ENDP</B></A>, at least for the FOR-AS-IN <P>
 case.  Harlequin has apparently implemented the broken semantics of <P>
 &quot;X3J13/89-004 page 2-10&quot;.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
 This typo has gone undetected for over two years, between January 1989 <P>
 until about April 1991, when a fresh implementation of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/m_loop.htm#loop"><B>LOOP</B></A> taken purely <P>
 &quot;from the spec&quot; produced anomalous results on LOOP-FOR-AS-ON termination <P>
 tests.  Lawrence G. Mayka &lt;lgm@iexist.att.com&gt; noticed the variation when <P>
 comparing Harlequin's <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/m_loop.htm#loop"><B>LOOP</B></A> implementation with some of the others.<P>
<P>
<P>
 Jonl 11-Apr-91:  I know this (the use of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_atom.htm#atom"><B>ATOM</B></A> for FOR-AS-ON termination) <P>
    was discussed and agreed upon; and I hope that the forum of discussion <P>
    was within X3J13, either the iteration subcommittee or the whole <P>
    committee.  I even recall changing Lucid's implementation after this <P>
    decision. [And an edit-history record of that change, along with the<P>
    rationale cited above, still exists in the Lucid source code for<P>
    Loop, dated 9-May-88.]<P>
