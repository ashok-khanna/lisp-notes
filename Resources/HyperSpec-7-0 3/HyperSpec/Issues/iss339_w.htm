<B>Problem description:<P>
</B><P>
Proposal <A HREF="iss337.htm">SYMBOL-MACROLET-DECLARE:ALLOW</A> says that a type declaration of<P>
a symbol defined as a symbol-macro &quot;is equivalent to wrapping a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/s_the.htm#the"><B>THE</B></A><P>
expression around the expansion of that symbol&quot;.  There is disagreement<P>
about whether &quot;equivalence&quot; was intended to mean &quot;semantic equivalence&quot;<P>
or &quot;literal equivalence&quot;.  In other words, must (or might) the value <P>
returned by <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand"><B>MACROEXPAND</B></A> or <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand-1"><B>MACROEXPAND-1</B></A> include a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/s_the.htm#the"><B>THE</B></A> form if there<P>
are type declarations that apply to the symbol-macro being expanded?<P>
<P>
There are four proposals, YES, NO, MAYBE, and PROBABLY.<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (SYMBOL-MACROLET-TYPE-DECLARATION:YES):<P>
</B><P>
  Clarify that the equivalence is literal.  If a type declaration<P>
  is provided for a name that is bound as a symbol-macro, that type<P>
  information must appear in the expansion of the symbol-macro <P>
  returned by <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand"><B>MACROEXPAND</B></A> or <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand-1"><B>MACROEXPAND-1</B></A> as a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/s_the.htm#the"><B>THE</B></A> form wrapped around <P>
  the expansion provided in its definition.<P>
<P>
  Rationale for proposal YES:<P>
<P>
    If the macroexpansion doesn't include the type information, it can<P>
    be lost completely.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (SYMBOL-MACROLET-TYPE-DECLARATION:NO):<P>
</B><P>
  Clarify that the equivalence is only in effect.  The macroexpansion <P>
  of a symbol-macro returned by <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand"><B>MACROEXPAND</B></A> or <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand-1"><B>MACROEXPAND-1</B></A> is exactly<P>
  the expansion provided in its definition.<P>
<P>
  Rationale for proposal NO:<P>
<P>
    As long as we permit implementations to discard declarations as a <P>
    matter of policy, it's unreasonable type declarations on symbol<P>
    macros to be collected.<P>
<P>
    Type declarations about symbol-macros need not be lost during<P>
    macroexpansion, since this information is returned by the<P>
    VARIABLE-INFORMATION function.  A code walker could wrap a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/s_the.htm#the"><B>THE</B></A><P>
    form around the expansion returned by <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand-1"><B>MACROEXPAND-1</B></A> itself, if<P>
    it wished to do so.<P>
<P>
    Maybe some programs depend on the expansion of a symbol-macro being<P>
    exactly the same as what was specified in its definition.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (SYMBOL-MACROLET-TYPE-DECLARATION:MAYBE):<P>
</B><P>
  Clarify that the equivalence may be either literal or only in effect.<P>
  The macroexpansion of a symbol-macro returned by <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand"><B>MACROEXPAND</B></A> or<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand-1"><B>MACROEXPAND-1</B></A> might or might not include a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/s_the.htm#the"><B>THE</B></A> form wrapped around<P>
  the the expansion provided in its definition.<P>
<P>
  Rationale for proposal MAYBE:<P>
<P>
    Some implementations might want to do things this way.  Other<P>
    implementations might not.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (SYMBOL-MACROLET-TYPE-DECLARATION:PROBABLY):<P>
</B><P>
  Clarify that the equivalence is literal.  If there is type information<P>
  available in the environment in which the expansion occurs, then that<P>
  type information must appear in the expansion of the symbol-macro <P>
  returned by <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand"><B>MACROEXPAND</B></A> or <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand-1"><B>MACROEXPAND-1</B></A> as a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/s_the.htm#the"><B>THE</B></A> form wrapped around <P>
  the expansion provided in its definition.<P>
<P>
  Rationale for proposal PROBABLY:<P>
<P>
    If the macroexpansion doesn't include the type information, it can<P>
    be lost completely.  However, this proposal makes no requirement that<P>
    type declarations actually be collected (but it does imply that<P>
    type declarations added by an explicit use of AUGMENT-ENVIRONMENT<P>
    will be reflected in the expansions).<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
  I don't know.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Implementors:<P>
</B><P>
  In an implementation that discards type declarations, probably quite<P>
  a bit of work would be involved to support proposal YES.  However it<P>
  may be that the implementors are doing this work anyway to support<P>
  the other <A HREF="iss342.htm">syntactic-environment-access</A> proposals.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Users:<P>
</B><P>
  Hard to say.  Probably there are few programs that depend on any<P>
  particular behavior here.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost of non-adoption:<P>
</B><P>
  Continuing confusion about how to write a code walker.<P>
<P>
<B>Performance impact:<P>
</B><P>
  Most of the overhead is in keeping track of type declarations.<P>
<P>
<B>Benefits:<P>
</B><P>
  The cost of non-adoption is avoided.<P>
<P>
<B>Esthetics:<P>
</B><P>
  Seems to depend on who you talk to.<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
  Kim Barrett supports proposal PROBABLY.<P>
<P>
  Kent Pitman says:<P>
    ...unless we're going to force declarations to be enforced, it <P>
   isn't reasonable to make this requirement on macroexpansion.<P>
<P>
  Loosemore supports proposal NO, not only because of this problem,<P>
  but because it just seems unnecessarily complicated to force <P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mexp_.htm#macroexpand"><B>MACROEXPAND</B></A> to deal with declarations when there are other mechanisms <P>
  for retrieving this information available to code walkers.<P>
