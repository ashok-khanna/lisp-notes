<B>References:</B>   File System Interface (pp409-427)<P>
<B>Category:</B>     CLARIFICATION<P>
<B>Edit history:</B> 07-Jul-88, Version 1 by Pitman<P>
<B>Status:</B>	      For Internal Discussion<P>
<P>
<B>Problem Description:<P>
</B><P>
  There exist conceivable pathnames for which there is no valid mapping in a<P>
  particular implementation. CLtL is not clear about the time at which this<P>
  error might be detected.<P>
<P>
  For example, on file systems which constrain pathname-types to be three<P>
  letters or fewer, the type &quot;LISP&quot; is not valid. The question arises: when<P>
  is this error detected?<P>
<P>
  In some implementations, the error might be detected while forming the<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A>. That is, (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> :TYPE &quot;LISP&quot;) signals an error.<P>
<P>
  In some implementations, the error might be detected while forming the<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>namestring</B></A>. That is, (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> :TYPE &quot;LISP&quot;) succeeds, but<P>
  (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>NAMESTRING</B></A> (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> :TYPE &quot;LISP&quot;)) signals an error.<P>
<P>
  In some implementations, validity checking might be done only by the host<P>
  operating system, so Lisp does not detect the error unless the operating<P>
  system complains. For example, (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> :TYPE &quot;LISP&quot;) succeeds,<P>
  and even (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>NAMESTRING</B></A> (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> :TYPE &quot;LISP&quot;)) constructs a plausible<P>
  looking <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A>, but (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_open.htm#open"><B>OPEN</B></A> (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>NAMESTRING</B></A> (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> :TYPE &quot;LISP&quot;))) fails.<P>
<P>
  In some implementations, Lisp might make `friendly' corrections to the<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> in order to form a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>namestring</B></A>. For example,<P>
  (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> :TYPE &quot;LISP&quot;) might succeed, but <P>
  (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>NAMESTRING</B></A> (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> :TYPE &quot;LISP&quot;)) might produce a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>namestring</B></A> with<P>
  an extension such as &quot;.LIS&quot; or &quot;.LSP&quot;.<P>
<P>
  Similar issues might come up in file systems which don't allow wildcard<P>
  pathnames. Is :WILD allowed in a name or type slot and then disallowed<P>
  upon coercion to a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A>, or is :WILD complained about &quot;up front&quot;?<P>
<P>
  This phenomenon is a barrier to portability because if a program is<P>
  debugged in an implementation that does, for example, NAMESTRING-time<P>
  error checking, the programmer may be lulled into an expectation that<P>
  it is acceptable to construct and manipulate invalid pathnames as long<P>
  as the problem is caught before an attempt to call <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>NAMESTRING</B></A> is<P>
  attempted. On the other hand, another programmer may debug his code in<P>
  a Lisp which does early error checking of syntax and may assume that <P>
  he is home free if the <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> gets constructed correctly.<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (PATHNAME-SYNTAX-ERROR-TIME:PATHNAME-CREATION):<P>
</B><P>
  Clarify that operations such as <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> and MERGE-PATHNMES which<P>
  construct new pathnames do plausibility checking of their arguments<P>
  and signal an error rather than construct a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> for which <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>NAMESTRING</B></A><P>
  would not produce a valid <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A>.<P>
<P>
  Rationale:<P>
<P>
    This would identify clearly to the programmer where he should expect an<P>
    error to be signalled for a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A>.<P>
<P>
    This would mean that fully constructed pathnames could reliably<P>
    be converted to namestrings.<P>
<P>
  Cost to Implementors:<P>
  <P>
    Some implementors, especially those which rely on the operating system<P>
    to be the sole authority on <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> syntax, might have to introduce<P>
    some new syntax-checking facilities.<P>
<P>
    Implementations where this error checking is done later would have to be<P>
    changed both to do it earlier, and to not make the unwarranted assumption<P>
    that pathnames with no valid <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>namestring</B></A> representation are constructable.<P>
<P>
  Cost to Users:<P>
<P>
    The ability to represent non-viable pathnames for the purpose of merging<P>
    would be lost. This feature was not portably available, but was available<P>
    in some operating systems.<P>
<P>
    Some code which expected an error, but expected it at a different time<P>
    would have to be changed.<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (PATHNAME-SYNTAX-ERROR-TIME:NAMESTRING-COERCION):<P>
</B><P>
  Clarify that it was valid to create a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> which could not be<P>
  converted to a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>namestring</B></A>. Require <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>NAMESTRING</B></A> (and related functions,<P>
  such as <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#enough-namestring"><B>ENOUGH-NAMESTRING</B></A> or any internal functions that might be used<P>
  in place of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>NAMESTRING</B></A> by functions like <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_open.htm#open"><B>OPEN</B></A> and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_probe_.htm#probe-file"><B>PROBE-FILE</B></A>) to signal<P>
  an error for pathnames which do not represent valid filenames in the<P>
  designated file system.<P>
<P>
  Rationale:<P>
<P>
    This would identify clearly to the programmer where he should expect an<P>
    error to be signalled for a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A>.<P>
<P>
    This would allow the construction of pathnames for the sole purpose of<P>
    merging without causing what might seem to some as gratuitous errors.<P>
<P>
  Cost to Implementors:<P>
  <P>
    Implementors who rely on the operating system to be the sole authority<P>
    on <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> syntax, might have to introduce some new syntax-checking<P>
    facilities.<P>
<P>
    Implementations where this error checking is done earlier would have to<P>
    be changed both to do it later, and to not make the unwarranted<P>
    assumption that any <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> has a valid <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>namestring</B></A> representation.<P>
<P>
  Cost to Users:<P>
<P>
    Early error checking of faulty pathnames would be lost.<P>
<P>
    Some code which expected an error, but expected it at a different time<P>
    would have to be changed.<P>
<P>
  Benefits:<P>
  <P>
    Macsyma, for example, has encountered a need for &quot;hostless&quot; pathnames<P>
    (in merging). The concept makes no sense if every <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> must have<P>
    a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>namestring</B></A>, because a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> with no host cannot have a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>namestring</B></A>.<P>
    However, if it's <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>NAMESTRING</B></A>'s responsibility to signal an error, then<P>
    hostless pathnames are still useful for merging. Consider:<P>
	(<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_merge_.htm#merge-pathnames"><B>MERGE-PATHNAMES</B></A> (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> :NAME &quot;FRED&quot;) MARY)<P>
    This will override both the NAME and the HOST field of MARY because you<P>
    must currently have a host in every <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A>. But if <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_mk_pn.htm#make-pathname"><B>MAKE-PATHNAME</B></A> did<P>
    not force the host, or if one could explicitly say :HOST <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_nil.htm#nil"><B>NIL</B></A>, then<P>
    such pathnames would be considerably more useful for merging.<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (PATHNAME-SYNTAX-ERROR-TIME:EXPLICITLY-VAGUE):<P>
</B><P>
  Clarify that we were unable to reach agreement on this issue and that<P>
  the time at which this error detection occurs is not well-specified.<P>
<P>
  Advise the editorial group to warn users clearly about this known source<P>
  of program portability problems.<P>
<P>
  Rationale:<P>
<P>
    This implements the status quo.<P>
<P>
  Cost to Implementors:<P>
  <P>
    None.<P>
<P>
  Cost to Users:<P>
<P>
    No existing code must be modified, but there is an ongoing cost<P>
    associated with providing error checking at multiple points in a<P>
    program because implementations disagree as to where an error<P>
    might be signalled. In some cases, the effects of having to handle<P>
    this in multiple places may cause unpleasant modularity violations.<P>
<P>
<B>Test Case:<P>
</B><P>
  See problem description.<P>
<P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
  Symbolics Genera signals an error at <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> construction time if a<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> will be invalid. Once a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> is successfully constructed,<P>
  it can generally be assumed that <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_namest.htm#namestring"><B>NAMESTRING</B></A> will always succeed.<P>
<P>
<B>Aesthetics:<P>
</B><P>
  Making this more well-defined would cause a definite aesthetic<P>
  improvement to some programs.<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
  Pitman prefers PATHNAME-SYNTAX-ERROR-TIME:NAMESTRING-COERCION but<P>
  believes that anything is an improvement over ...:EXPLICITLY-VAGUE.<P>
<P>
  CL <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> functions were not adequate for use in Macsyma because<P>
  they did not adequately represent to-be-merged-only pathnames (a<P>
  feature used very extensively in Macsyma), because errors could be<P>
  signalled at radically different times. To get around this, Pitman<P>
  had to create a data <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_docume.htm#structure"><B>structure</B></A> in Macsyma called an MPATHNAME which<P>
  was only trivially different than a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>PATHNAME</B></A> but which made it<P>
  possible to deal portably with this issue of when errors occurred<P>
  and what kinds of errors occured. Unfortunately, since none of the<P>
  CL functions worked on MPATHNAMEs, a whole series of functions,<P>
  also only trivially different, had to be created: MAKE-MPATHNAME,<P>
  MNAMESTRING, MERGE-MPATHNAMES, MPATHNAME-NAME, MPATHNAME-TYPE, <P>
  MOPEN, WITH-MOPEN-FILE, etc.<P>
<P>
------<P>
Summary of CL-Cleanup discussion:<P>
<P>
Most of the mail was endorsements for option PATHNAME-CREATION.<P>
Sandra brought up a tangential issue about truenames that eventually<P>
became a separate issue.<P>
<P>
I think I'm the only person pushing NAMESTRING-COERCION. I strongly<P>
believe it is the right thing, and that PATHNAME-CREATION is suboptimal,<P>
based on problems that have struck me with existing CL <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/a_pn.htm#pathname"><B>pathname</B></A> system.<P>
However, even PATHNAME-CREATION would be an improvement from a<P>
portability standpoint and I am probably not going to push it because<P>
there are compatibility issues on the side of PATHNAME-CREATION (many<P>
implementations do this already), and because there are more important<P>
issues for us to spend time on at the meeting.<P>
<P>
[Please try to come prepared to vote yes on one or both of<P>
 PATHNAME-CREATION or NAMESTRING-COERCION so we don't have to fall back<P>
 on EXPLICITLY-VAGUE, which is a total loss for program portability.<P>
