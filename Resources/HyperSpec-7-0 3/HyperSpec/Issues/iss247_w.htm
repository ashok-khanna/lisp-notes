              Version 4, 7-Jun-92, Kim Barrett<P>
<B>Status:</B>       Confusion!  One of the proposals (REVERT or PERMIT) was passed at<P>
              the 12/91 meeting, but there is disagrement as to which.<P>
              Draft 12.24 (X3J13/92-102) was written assuming that REVERT was<P>
              the passed proposal.<P>
              Barrett now asks us to reconsider proposal PERMIT.<P>
	      Proposal REVERT passed 11-0 on letter ballot 93-302;<P>
              on same ballot, proposal PERMIT failed 2-6.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Problem Description:<P>
</B><P>
 Issue <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A> permits <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_isec_.htm#nintersection"><B>NINTERSECTION</B></A> to modify either list<P>
 argument, contrary to the description of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_isec_.htm#nintersection"><B>NINTERSECTION</B></A> in CLtL, which<P>
 explicitly states that the second argument (list2) is not destroyed.  It is<P>
 questionable whether this change was intentional or not, especially since<P>
 <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A> was categorized as a clarification rather than a<P>
 change.  <P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (NINTERSECTION-DESTRUCTION:REVERT):<P>
</B><P>
 Affirm the wording from CLtL, prohibiting <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_isec_.htm#nintersection"><B>NINTERSECTION</B></A> from modifying the<P>
 second (list2) argument.<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (NINTERSECTION-DESTRUCTION:PERMIT):<P>
</B><P>
 Affirm the wording from <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A>, permitting <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_isec_.htm#nintersection"><B>NINTERSECTION</B></A><P>
 to modify either list argument.<P>
<P>
<B>Editorial Impact:<P>
</B><P>
 For REVERT:<P>
   None.  The 12.24 draft assumes that REVERT was accepted.<P>
<P>
 For PERMIT:<P>
   Small.  The two-line paragraph on p.14-51 of X3J13/92-102 describing the<P>
   difference between <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_isec_.htm#nintersection"><B>NINTERSECTION</B></A> and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_isec_.htm#intersection"><B>INTERSECTION</B></A> would have to be changed<P>
   slightly, specifying that both the LIST-1 and LIST-2 arguments may be<P>
   destroyed, rather than only permitting LIST-1 to be destroyed and requiring<P>
   that LIST-2 be preserved.<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
 For REVERT:<P>
   The intent of <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A> was not to change side-effect<P>
   behavior, but to tack down places where we had all pretty much agreed on<P>
   side-effect behavior but never spelled it out.  This was a case where CLtL<P>
   had spelled things out, and which was probably changed unintentionally.<P>
   Some older programs may depend on this argument not getting bashed, and it<P>
   would be a shame to have some implementation decide to bash it.<P>
<P>
   Don't make an apparently unintentional incompatible change.<P>
<P>
 For PERMIT:<P>
   Affirm the more recent decision, which went through more than two years of<P>
   discussion before finally being accepted.  The intent of<P>
   <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A> was to permit greater implementation freedom<P>
   in order to achieve better performance; prohibiting the destruction of one<P>
   of the lists may have a negative performance impact.<P>
<P>
   A ``destructive'' function that is only permitted to destroy one of it's two<P>
   arguments (with no rationale for which argument may be destroyed and which<P>
   may not) is confusing; this is the only case of such.<P>
<P>
<B>Examples:<P>
</B><P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
 Apple Macintosh Common Lisp 2.0 obeys REVERT.<P>
<P>
 Symbolics Genera 8.2 (and before) obeys REVERT.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Implementors:<P>
</B><P>
 None for PERMIT.<P>
<P>
 If REVERT is adopted, implementations that have been tracking the passed<P>
 cleanups and have taken advantage of the permission granted by<P>
 <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A> in this case will have to change.  It may <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_provid.htm#require"><B>require</B></A><P>
 a significant amount of work to achieve similar performance.  Implementations<P>
 that pre-existed the acceptance of that proposal may be able to revert to an<P>
 older source that obeyed the CLtL1 restriction.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Users:<P>
</B><P>
 For REVERT, no semantic cost for users; there may be a performance cost.<P>
<P>
 For PERMIT, an incompatible change.  In some cases it may be quite difficult<P>
 to determine whether a call to <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_isec_.htm#nintersection"><B>NINTERSECTION</B></A> can safely destroy the second<P>
 argument.<P>
<P>
<B>Performance Impact:<P>
</B><P>
 There may be a negative performance impact in choosing REVERT over PERMIT.<P>
<P>
 The ``obvious'' implementation is to iterate over the elements of one of the<P>
 lists and if that element appears in the other list then collect it, reusing<P>
 storage from the first list in the collection process.  If the length of the<P>
 first list is less than the length of the second, this algorithm is<P>
 asymptotically as much as a factor of two slower than if the lists were<P>
 exchanged.  Thus, by preventing such a choice of which list to destroy, REVERT<P>
 might result in slower performance for <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_isec_.htm#nintersection"><B>NINTERSECTION</B></A>.<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
 The status of this issue is unclear.<P>

    &gt; <P>
    &gt;     Does this look ok to you?<P>
    &gt; <P>
    &gt; No! My meeting notes say:<P>
    &gt; <P>
    &gt;  &quot;Move to say list-2 not modified.  PASS 8-2&quot;<P>
    &gt; <P>
    &gt; Lest you think I mis-noted this, I certainly remember lobbying for a<P>
    &gt; position which said that <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A> had made the<P>
    &gt; change unintentionally, and that we should revert the wording.  Had I<P>
    &gt; wanted to retain the wording, I would not have raised the issue.<P>
<P>
    Looks like we have a problem here.  My notes just say<P>
<P>
      &quot;NINTERSECTION-DESTRUCTION passed 8-2&quot;<P>
<P>
    which is not very helpful.  My memory says that we voted to affirm the<P>
    words in the draft (as stated in the draft writeup I sent you), but<P>
    obviously I could be mistaken.  Unfortunately, the minutes are also<P>
    ambiguous:<P>
<P>
      <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A><P>
      (In document 91-003b.)<P>
      Vote: 7 - 2. Passed.<P>
<P>
    There isn't any such thing in the specified document.  (I pointed this out<P>
    to Jan after the last version of minutes was mailed out).<P>
<P>
 The reference to <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A> in 91-003b was to the following<P>
 message:<P>

    Date: Tue, 16 Jul 1991 17:33-0400<P>
    From: Kent M Pitman &lt;KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM&gt;<P>
    Subject: possible issue <A HREF="iss247_m.htm">NINTERSECTION-DESTRUCTION</A><P>
    To: kab@chestnut.com<P>
    Cc: KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM, barmar@think.com, GLS@Think.COM<P>
<P>
    [Addressed to Kim because he's been keeping a list of my little nitpicks<P>
     and figuring out which shoudl be written up and distributed.  Other<P>
     relevant individuals cc'd in case they have comments.]<P>
<P>
    One of Barmar's reviews turned up the following...<P>
<P>
    CLtL said plainly that list-2 was not destroyed by <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_isec_.htm#nintersection"><B>NINTERSECTION</B></A>.<P>
<P>
    <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A> says quite clearly that it might be, even<P>
    though I think the intent of <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A> was mainly to<P>
    clarify points left vague by CLtL, not to introduce new things that were<P>
    possible to destroy.<P>
<P>
    The current draft is inconsistent in that in different places, it says<P>
    things that are consistent either with CLtL or with the cleanup issue.<P>
<P>
    The status quo is well-defined, so if no vote is taken I will believe<P>
    <A HREF="iss293.htm">REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED</A>.   But I don't think that people realized<P>
    they were making an incompatible change in this particular case, so I<P>
    wonder if the issue should be raised at X3J13 for confirmation.<P>
<P>
    As an aside, I note that CLtL2's wording also implies that this was a<P>
    &quot;clarification&quot; without making it apparent that an actual change had<P>
    occurred.<P>
