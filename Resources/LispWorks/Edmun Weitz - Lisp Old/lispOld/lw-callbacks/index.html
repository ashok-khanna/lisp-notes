<br>&nbsp;<br><h3><a name="why" class=none>Why would you want to do this?</a></h3>

LispWorks uses native threads on Windows but
usually <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/LWUG/html/lwuser-171.htm">you
can only call back into Lisp in a thread that was created by Lisp</a>.
According to the documentation, you can circumvent this if you deliver
a DLL but it is not really clear (at least to me) if and how one can
use the IDE for interactive development of programs (DLLs) that have
to deal with such "foreign" callbacks.
<p>
Well, it turns out that you can
use <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/LWRM/html/lwref-214.htm"><code>SAVE-IMAGE</code></a>
to save a Lisp image as a DLL and once you've figured out how to start
this DLL from a small C&nbsp;"driver" you can have your cake and eat
it too.  This is what the rest of the document is about.
<p>
Note: <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/news/news19.html">LispWorks&nbsp;5</a> <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/5093">doesn't
need this workaround anymore</a>.

<br>&nbsp;<br><h3><a name="disclaimer" class=none>Disclaimer</a></h3>

Of course, if you do what I describe here, you do it at your own risk.
I take no responsibility for anything that you may do as a result of
reading this page the contents of which are provided 'as is' with no
warranty. Yada, yada, yada...

<br>&nbsp;<br><h3><a name="lisp" class=none>The Lisp part</a></h3>

First, you have to create a file with Lisp code that'll take care of
creating the DLL image.  Mine looks like this:

<pre>
(in-package :cl-user)

(<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/LWRM/html/lwref-306.htm" class=noborder>load-all-patches</a>)

<font color=orange>;; customize here</font>
(let ((cwd (<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/LWRM/html/lwref-199.htm" class=noborder>get-working-directory</a>)))
  (load "/home/.lispworks-full")
  (<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/LWRM/html/lwref-172.htm" class=noborder>change-directory</a> cwd))

(push '("Environment startup" nil <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/UNIX/html/lwunix-8.htm" class=noborder>env:start-environment</a>)
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/LWRM/html/lwref-360.htm" class=noborder>mp:*initial-processes*</a>)

(<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/FLI/html/fli-72.htm" class=noborder>fli:define-foreign-callable</a> ("StartLisp" :calling-convention :cdecl)
    ())

(<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/LWRM/html/lwref-214.htm" class=noborder>save-image</a> "lispworks-4460.dll" <font color=orange>; the name of the DLL</font>
            :dll-exports '("StartLisp")
            :console :input)

(<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/LWRM/html/lwref-322.htm" class=noborder>quit</a>)
</pre>

The second form (below the orange comment) is optional.  This is what
I use to load <a href="http://weitz.de/lw-add-ons/">LW-ADD-ONS</a>
into the image and obviously you can load whatever you want at this
point.
<p>
Now open a Windows command prompt and enter something like the following:
<pre>
cd "c:\Program Files\LispWorks"
lispworks-4450.exe -init create-dll.lisp
</pre>
(This obviously assumes that your LispWorks installation is
in <code>c:\Program&nbsp;Files\LispWorks</code> and that you saved the
Lisp code above under the name <code>create-dll.lisp</code> in that
directory.)  Now you should have a DLL named <code>lispworks-4460.dll</code> there.

<br>&nbsp;<br><h3><a name="c" class=none>The C part</a></h3>

For this section you'll need a way to compile a little C/C++ program
on Windows.  (But see the <a href="#download">next section</a>.)  I
used <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">Microsoft Visual
Studio</a>&nbsp;.NET&nbsp;2003 but I think the
free <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/">Express
Edition</a> of Visual&nbsp;C++ should suffice.
<p>
First we need a <code>DEF</code> file for our DLL.  That's simple -
just create a text file <code>lispworks-4460.def</code> with these two lines
in it:
<pre>
EXPORTS
        StartLisp
</pre>
and put it into your LispWorks directory.  Now we create
a <code>LIB</code> file from this <code>DEF</code> file: In the same
command prompt window as <a href="#lisp">above</a> enter the following line
<pre>
lib /def:lispworks-4460.def
</pre>
You'll see a warning that you can ignore but as a result you'll get
two new files, <code>lispworks-4460.lib</code>
and <code>lispworks-4460.exp</code>.
<p>
Now start Visual Studio and create a new C++ Win32 console project.
There, in the file <code>stdafx.h</code> add this line at the end:
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
</pre>
The code file that initially contains the stub for
your <code>_tmain</code> function should consist of the following code:
<pre>
#include "stdafx.h"

extern "C" {
  __declspec(dllimport) void StartLisp(void);
}

int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[]) {
  StartLisp();
  FreeConsole();
  Sleep(INFINITE);
  return 0;
}
</pre>

Then go to "Project" > "Properties" > "Linker" > "Input" and add
"lispworks-4460.lib" under "Additional Dependencies."  Finally,
copy or move the file <code>lispworks-4460.lib</code> from the
LispWorks folder to your project folder for this Visual Studio
project.
<p>
You should now be able to build an EXE file.  Put this EXE into your
LispWorks folder (where you still have the DLL lying around that you
created in the <a href="#lisp">last section</a>) and start it by
double-clicking it.  This should start the familiar LispWorks IDE but
now foreign threads should be able to call into Lisp.

<br>&nbsp;<br><h3><a class=none name="download">I'm too lazy</a></h3>

If you're too lazy for the <a href="#c">C&nbsp;part</a> you can
download the EXE I created
from <a
href="http://weitz.de/files/LW.exe">http://weitz.de/files/LW.exe</a> (about 23&nbsp;kB)
after you've read the <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>.  It'll
look for a DLL called <code>lispworks-4460.dll</code> that exports a C
function <code>StartLisp</code> with no arguments.

<br>&nbsp;<br><h3><a class=none name="ack">Acknowledgements</a></h3>

Most of the above was <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/5119">explained to me</a> by
<a href="http://www.nicklevine.org/">Nick Levine</a>.  I just fiddled a bit with Visual Studio and wrote it all down.
