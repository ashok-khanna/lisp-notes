This is a quick hack to create a graphical overview (kind of) for the
CLOS classes that are named by external symbols from the CAPI and GP
packages.

The application was developed and tested using LispWorks 4.4.5 and
5.0.0 pro on Windows.  No attempt has been made to ensure that it
works with other versions of LispWorks.

Requirements: ASDF, LW-DOC.  (Google if you don't know them.)

Usage: (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :capi-overview)
       (capi-overview:create-capi-overview)

       See the documentation string of this function for more options.

       You can also use the special variables

         capi-overview:*font-size*
         capi-overview:*cellspacing*
         capi-overview:*cellpadding*

       to customize the output a bit.

In the generated HTML, if you move your mouse over one class then all
of its superclasses (if their names are external symbols of the CAPI
or the GP package) are highlighted in red and all of its subclasses
are highlighted in green.  Direct sub- and superclasses have a colored
background, others only have a colored border.  ("Direct" in this case
means that if there are intermediate classes their names aren't
exported.)  Subclasses are always located to the right of a class,
superclasses are always on the left.
