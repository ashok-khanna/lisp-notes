Complete documentation for URL-REWRITE can be found in the 'doc'
directory.

Installation

1. Probably the easiest way is

     (load "/path/to/url-rewrite/load.lisp")

   This should compile and load URL-REWRITE on most Common Lisp
   implementations.

2. With MK:DEFSYSTEM you can make a symbolic link from
   'url-rewrite.system' to your central registry
   (which by default is in '/usr/local/lisp/Registry/') and then issue
   the command

     (mk:compile-system "url-rewrite")

   Note that this relies on TRUENAME returning the original file a
   symbolic link is pointing to. This will only work with AllegroCL
   6.2 if you've applied all patches with (SYS:UPDATE-ALLEGRO).

3. You can also use ASDF instead of MK:DEFSYSTEM in a similar way
   (use the .asd files instead of the .system files).
