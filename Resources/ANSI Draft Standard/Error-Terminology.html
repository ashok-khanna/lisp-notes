<h4 class="subsection">1.4.2 Error Terminology</h4>

<p>Situations in which errors might, should, or must be signaled are described
in the standard.  The wording used to describe such situations is intended
to have precise meaning. The following list is a glossary of those meanings.

     <dl>
<dt><b>Safe code</b><dd><a name="index-safe-10"></a>
This is <i>code</i> processed with the <code>safety</code> optimization
at its highest setting (<code>3</code>).  <code>safety</code> is a lexical property
of code.  The phrase &ldquo;the function <code>F</code> should signal an error&rdquo;
means that if <code>F</code> is invoked from code processed with the highest
<code>safety</code> optimization, an error is signaled. 
It is <i>implementation-dependent</i> whether <code>F</code> or the calling
code signals the error.

     <br><dt><b>Unsafe code</b><dd><a name="index-unsafe-11"></a>
This is code processed with lower safety levels.

     <p>Unsafe code might do error checking.  Implementations are permitted to
treat all code as safe code all the time.

     <br><dt><b>An error is signaled</b><dd>
<a name="index-signal-12"></a><a name="index-is-signaled-13"></a><a name="index-must-signal-14"></a>
This means that an error is signaled in both safe and unsafe code. 
<i>Conforming code</i> may rely on the fact that the error is signaled
in both safe and unsafe code.  Every implementation is required to
detect the error in both safe and unsafe code. For example, &ldquo;an error
is signaled if <code>unexport</code> is given a <i>symbol</i>
not <i>accessible</i> in the <i>current package</i>.&rdquo;

     <p>If an explicit error type is not specified, the default is <code>error</code>.

     <br><dt><b>An error should be signaled</b><dd>
<a name="index-signal-15"></a><a name="index-should-signal-16"></a>
This means that an error is signaled in safe code, and an error
might be signaled in unsafe code.  <i>Conforming code</i> may rely on the
fact that the error is signaled in safe code.  Every
implementation is required to detect the error at least in safe code. 
When the error is not signaled, the &ldquo;consequences are undefined&rdquo;
(see below).  For example, &ldquo;<code>+</code> should signal an error of <i>type</i> <code>type-error</code>
if any argument is not of <i>type</i> <code>number</code>.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><b>Should be prepared to signal an error</b><dd>
<a name="index-signal-17"></a><a name="index-prepared-to-signal-18"></a>
This is similar to &ldquo;should be signaled&rdquo; except that it does not
imply that `extra effort' has to be taken on the part of an <i>operator</i>
to discover an erroneous situation if the normal action of that <i>operator</i>
can be performed successfully with only `lazy' checking. 
An <i>implementation</i> is always permitted to signal an error,
but even in <i>safe</i> <i>code</i>, it is only required to signal the error
when failing to signal it might lead to incorrect results. 
In <i>unsafe</i> <i>code</i>, the consequences are undefined.

     <p>For example, defining that
&ldquo;<code>find</code> should be prepared to signal an error of <i>type</i> <code>type-error</code>
if its second <i>argument</i> is not a <i>proper list</i>&rdquo;
does not imply that an error is always signaled.  The <i>form</i>

     <pre class="lisp">      (find 'a '(a b . c))
</pre>
     <p>must either signal an error of <i>type</i> <code>type-error</code> in <i>safe</i> <i>code</i>,
else return <code>A</code>. 
In <i>unsafe</i> <i>code</i>, the consequences are undefined. 
By contrast,

     <pre class="lisp">      (find 'd '(a b . c))
</pre>
     <p>must signal an error of <i>type</i> <code>type-error</code> in <i>safe</i> <i>code</i>. 
In <i>unsafe</i> <i>code</i>, the consequences are undefined. 
Also,

     <pre class="lisp">      (find 'd '#1=(a b . #1#))
</pre>
     <p>in <i>safe code</i>
might return <code>nil</code>&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->(as an <i>implementation-defined</i> extension),
might never return,
or might signal an error of <i>type</i> <code>type-error</code>. 
In <i>unsafe</i> <i>code</i>, the consequences are undefined.

     <p>Typically, the &ldquo;should be prepared to signal&rdquo; terminology is used in
type checking situations where there are efficiency considerations that
make it impractical to detect errors that are not relevant to the
correct operation of the <i>operator</i>.

     <br><dt><b>The consequences are unspecified</b><dd>
<a name="index-consequences-19"></a><a name="index-unspecified-consequences-20"></a>
This means that the consequences are unpredictable but harmless. 
Implementations are permitted to specify the consequences of this
situation. No <i>conforming code</i> may depend on the results or effects of
this situation, and all <i>conforming code</i> is required to treat the
results and effects of this situation as unpredictable but harmless. 
For example, &ldquo;if the second argument to <code>shared-initialize</code>
specifies a name that does not correspond to any <i>slots</i>
<i>accessible</i> in the <i>object</i>, the results are unspecified.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><b>The consequences are undefined</b><dd>
<a name="index-consequences-21"></a><a name="index-undefined-consequences-22"></a>
This means that the consequences are unpredictable. The consequences
may range from harmless to fatal.  No <i>conforming code</i> may depend on
the results or effects. <i>Conforming code</i> must treat the consequences as
unpredictable.  In places where the words &ldquo;must,&rdquo; &ldquo;must not,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;may not&rdquo; are used, then &ldquo;the consequences are undefined&rdquo; if the
stated requirement is not met and no specific consequence is
explicitly stated.  An implementation is permitted to signal an error
in this case.

     <p>For example: &ldquo;Once a name has been declared by <code>defconstant</code>
to be constant, any further assignment or binding of that
variable has undefined consequences.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><b>An error might be signaled</b><dd>
<a name="index-signal-23"></a><a name="index-might-signal-24"></a>
This means that the situation has undefined consequences;
however, if an error is signaled, it is of the specified <i>type</i>. 
For example, &ldquo;<code>open</code> might signal an error of <i>type</i> <code>file-error</code>.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><b>The return values are unspecified</b><dd>
<a name="index-unspecified-values-25"></a>
This means that only the number and nature of the return values of a
<i>form</i> are not specified.  However, the issue of whether or not
any side-effects or transfer of control occurs is still well-specified.

     <p>A program can be well-specified even if it uses a function whose
returns values are unspecified.  For example, even if the return
values of some function <code>F</code> are unspecified, an expression such as
<code>(length (list (F)))</code> is still well-specified because it does not
rely on any particular aspect of the value or values returned by <code>F</code>.

     <br><dt><b>Implementations may be extended to cover this situation</b><dd>
<a name="index-extensions-26"></a>
This means that the <i>situation</i> has undefined consequences;
however, a <i>conforming implementation</i> is free to treat
the situation in a more specific way. 
For example, an <i>implementation</i> might define
that      an error is signaled,
or that      an error should be signaled,
or even that a certain well-defined non-error behavior occurs.

     <p>No <i>conforming code</i> may depend on the consequences of such a <i>situation</i>;
all <i>conforming code</i> must treat the consequences of the situation
as undefined. <i>Implementations</i> are required to document how the
situation is treated.

     <p>For example, &ldquo;implementations may be extended to define other type
specifiers to have a corresponding <i>class</i>.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><b>Implementations are free to extend the syntax</b><dd>
<a name="index-extensions-27"></a>
This means that in this situation implementations are permitted to
define unambiguous extensions to the syntax of the <i>form</i> being
described.  No <i>conforming code</i> may depend on this extension. 
Implementations are required to document each such extension. All
<i>conforming code</i> is required to treat the syntax as meaningless. The
standard might disallow certain extensions while allowing others. For
example, &ldquo;no implementation is free to extend the syntax of
<code>defclass</code>.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><b>A warning might be issued</b><dd>
<a name="index-warning-28"></a>
This means that <i>implementations</i> are encouraged to issue a warning
if the context is appropriate (<i>e.g.</i>, when compiling).  However, a
<i>conforming implementation</i> is not required to issue a warning.
