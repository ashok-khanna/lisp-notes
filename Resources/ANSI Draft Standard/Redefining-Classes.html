<h4 class="subsection">4.3.6 Redefining Classes</h4>

<p>A <i>class</i> that is a <i>direct instance</i> of <code>standard-class</code> can
be redefined if the new <i>class</i> is also
a <i>direct instance</i> of <code>standard-class</code>. 
Redefining a <i>class</i> modifies the existing
<i>class</i> <i>object</i> to reflect the new <i>class</i> definition; it does not
create a new <i>class</i> <i>object</i> for the <i>class</i>. 
Any <i>method</i> <i>object</i> created by a <tt>:reader</tt>, <tt>:writer</tt>,
or <tt>:accessor</tt> option specified by the old <code>defclass</code> form is
removed from the corresponding <i>generic function</i>. 
<i>Methods</i> specified by the new <code>defclass</code> form are added.

<p>When the class C is redefined, changes are propagated to its <i>instances</i>
and to <i>instances</i> of any of its <i>subclasses</i>.  Updating such an
<i>instance</i> occurs at an <i>implementation-dependent</i> time, but no later than
the next time a <i>slot</i>
of that <i>instance</i> is read or written.  Updating an
<i>instance</i>
does not change its identity as defined by the <i>function</i> <code>eq</code>. 
The updating process may change the <i>slots</i> of that
particular <i>instance</i>,
but it does not create a new <i>instance</i>.  Whether
updating an <i>instance</i> consumes storage is <i>implementation-dependent</i>.

<p>Note that redefining a <i>class</i> may cause <i>slots</i> to be added or
deleted.  If a <i>class</i> is redefined in a way that changes the set of
<i>local slots</i> <i>accessible</i> in <i>instances</i>, the <i>instances</i>
are updated.  It is <i>implementation-dependent</i> whether <i>instances</i>
are updated if a <i>class</i> is redefined in a way that does not change
the set of <i>local slots</i> <i>accessible</i> in <i>instances</i>.

<p>The value of a <i>slot</i>
that is specified as shared both in the old <i>class</i>
and in the new <i>class</i> is retained. 
If such a <i>shared slot</i> was unbound
in the old <i>class</i>, it is unbound in the new <i>class</i>. 
<i>Slots</i> that
were local in the old <i>class</i> and that are shared in the new
<i>class</i> are
initialized.  Newly added <i>shared slots</i> are initialized.

<p>Each newly added <i>shared slot</i> is set to the result of evaluating the
<i>captured initialization form</i> for the <i>slot</i> that was specified
in the <code>defclass</code> <i>form</i> for the new <i>class</i>. 
If there was no <i>initialization form</i>, the <i>slot</i> is unbound.

<p>If a <i>class</i> is redefined in such a way that the set of
<i>local slots</i> <i>accessible</i> in an <i>instance</i> of the <i>class</i>
is changed, a two-step process of updating the <i>instances</i> of the
<i>class</i> takes place.  The process may be explicitly started by
invoking the generic function <code>make-instances-obsolete</code>.  This
two-step process can happen in other circumstances in some implementations. 
For example, in some implementations this two-step process is
triggered if the order of <i>slots</i> in storage is changed.

<p>The first step modifies the structure of the <i>instance</i> by adding new
<i>local slots</i> and discarding <i>local slots</i> that are not
defined in the new version of the <i>class</i>.  The second step
initializes the newly-added <i>local slots</i> and performs any other
user-defined actions. These two steps are further specified
in the next two sections.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.3.6.1 Modifying the Structure of Instances</h5>

<p>The first step modifies the structure of <i>instances</i> of the redefined
<i>class</i> to conform to its new <i>class</i> definition. 
<i>Local slots</i> specified
by the new <i>class</i> definition that are not specified as either local or
shared by the old <i>class</i> are added, and <i>slots</i>
not specified as either
local or shared by the new <i>class</i> definition that are specified as
local by the old <i>class</i> are discarded. 
The <i>names</i> of these added and discarded
<i>slots</i> are passed as arguments
to <code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code>
as described in the next section.

<p>The values of <i>local slots</i> specified by both the new and old
<i>classes</i> are retained. If such a <i>local slot</i> was unbound,
it remains unbound.

<p>The value of a <i>slot</i> that is specified as shared in the old
<i>class</i> and as local in the new <i>class</i> is retained.  If such
a <i>shared slot</i> was unbound, the <i>local slot</i> is unbound.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.3.6.2 Initializing Newly Added Local Slots</h5>

<p>The second step initializes the newly added <i>local slots</i> and performs
any other user-defined actions.  This step is implemented by the generic
function <code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code>, which is called after
completion of the first step of modifying the structure of the
<i>instance</i>.

<p>The generic function <code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code> takes
four required arguments: the <i>instance</i> being updated after it has
undergone the first step, a list of the names of <i>local slots</i> that were
added, a list of the names of <i>local slots</i> that were discarded, and a
property list containing the <i>slot</i> names and values of
<i>slots</i> that were
discarded and had values.  Included among the discarded <i>slots</i> are
<i>slots</i> that were local in the old <i>class</i> and that are shared in the new
<i>class</i>.

<p>The generic function <code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code> also
takes any number of initialization arguments.  When it is called by
the system to update an <i>instance</i> whose <i>class</i>
has been redefined, no
initialization arguments are provided.

<p>There is a system-supplied primary <i>method</i> for
<code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code> whose <i>parameter specializer</i>
for its <i>instance</i> argument is the <i>class</i> <code>standard-object</code>. 
First this <i>method</i> checks the validity of initialization arguments and signals an
error if an initialization argument is supplied that is not declared
as valid.  (For more information, see <a href="Declaring-the-Validity-of-Initialization-Arguments.html#Declaring-the-Validity-of-Initialization-Arguments">Section 7.1.2 (Declaring the Validity of Initialization Arguments)</a>.) 
Then it calls the generic function
<code>shared-initialize</code> with the following arguments: the
<i>instance</i>,
the list of <i>names</i> of
the newly added <i>slots</i>, and the initialization
arguments it received.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.3.6.3 Customizing Class Redefinition</h5>

<p><i>Methods</i> for <code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code> may be
defined to specify actions to be taken when an <i>instance</i> is updated. 
If only <i>after methods</i> for <code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code> are
defined, they will be run after the system-supplied primary <i>method</i> for
initialization and therefore will not interfere with the default
behavior of <code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code>.  Because no
initialization arguments are passed to <code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code>
when it is called by the system, the
<i>initialization forms</i> for <i>slots</i>
that are filled by <i>before methods</i> for <code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code>
will not be evaluated by <code>shared-initialize</code>.

<p><i>Methods</i> for <code>shared-initialize</code> may be defined to customize
<i>class</i> redefinition.  For more information, see <a href="Shared_002dInitialize.html#Shared_002dInitialize">Section 7.1.5 (Shared-Initialize)</a>.
