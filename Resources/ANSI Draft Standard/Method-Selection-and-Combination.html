<h4 class="subsection">7.6.6 Method Selection and Combination</h4>

<p>When a <i>generic function</i> is called with particular arguments, it must
determine the code to execute.  This code is called the
<a name="index-effective-method-707"></a><dfn>effective method</dfn> for those <i>arguments</i>. 
The <i>effective method</i> is a
combination of the <i>applicable methods</i> in the <i>generic function</i>
that <i>calls</i> some or all of the <i>methods</i>.

<p>If a <i>generic function</i> is called and no <i>methods</i> are
<i>applicable</i>, the <i>generic function</i> <code>no-applicable-method</code>
is invoked, with the <i>results</i> from that call being used as the
<i>results</i> of the call to the original <i>generic function</i>.  Calling
<code>no-applicable-method</code> takes precedence over checking for acceptable
keyword arguments; see <a href="Keyword-Arguments-in-Generic-Functions-and-Methods.html#Keyword-Arguments-in-Generic-Functions-and-Methods">Section 7.6.5 (Keyword Arguments in Generic Functions and Methods)</a>.

<p>When the <i>effective method</i> has been determined,
it is invoked with the same <i>arguments</i> as were passed to the <i>generic function</i>. 
Whatever <i>values</i> it returns are returned as the <i>values</i>
of the <i>generic function</i>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">7.6.6.1 Determining the Effective Method</h5>

<p><a name="DeterminingtheEffectiveMethod"></a>The effective method is determined by the following three-step procedure:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Select the applicable methods.

     <li>Sort the applicable methods by precedence order, putting
the most specific method first.

     <li>Apply method combination to the sorted list of
applicable methods, producing the effective method.
     </ol>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">7.6.6.1.1 Selecting the Applicable Methods</h5>

<p><a name="SelApplMeth"></a>This step is described in <a href="Introduction-to-Methods.html#Introduction-to-Methods">Section 7.6.2 (Introduction to Methods)</a>.

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">7.6.6.1.2 Sorting the Applicable Methods by Precedence Order</h5>

<p>To compare the precedence of two methods, their <i>parameter specializers</i>
are examined in order.  The default examination order is from left to
right, but an alternative order may be specified by the
<tt>:argument-precedence-order</tt> option to <code>defgeneric</code> or to any of
the other operators that specify generic function options.

<p>The corresponding <i>parameter specializers</i> from each method are
compared.  When a pair of <i>parameter specializers</i> agree, the next
pair are compared for agreement.  If all corresponding parameter
specializers agree, the two methods must have different
<i>qualifiers</i>; in this case, either method can be selected to precede the
other.  For information about agreement, see <a href="Agreement-on-Parameter-Specializers-and-Qualifiers.html#Agreement-on-Parameter-Specializers-and-Qualifiers">Section 7.6.3 (Agreement on Parameter Specializers and Qualifiers)</a>.

<p>If some corresponding <i>parameter specializers</i> do not agree, the first
pair of <i>parameter specializers</i> that do not agree determines the
precedence.  If both <i>parameter specializers</i> are classes, the more
specific of the two methods is the method whose <i>parameter specializer</i>
appears earlier in the <i>class precedence list</i> of the corresponding
argument.  Because of the way in which the set of applicable methods
is chosen, the <i>parameter specializers</i> are guaranteed to be present in
the class precedence list of the class of the argument.

<p>If just one of a pair of corresponding <i>parameter specializers</i> is <code>(eql </code><i>object</i><code>)</code>,
the <i>method</i> with that <i>parameter specializer</i> precedes the
other <i>method</i>.  If both <i>parameter specializers</i> are <code>eql</code>
<i>expressions</i>, the
specializers must agree (otherwise the two <i>methods</i> would
not both have been applicable to this argument).

<p>The resulting list of <i>applicable methods</i> has the most specific
<i>method</i> first and the least specific <i>method</i> last.

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">7.6.6.1.3 Applying method combination to the sorted list of applicable methods</h5>

<p><a name="ApplyMethCombToSortedMethods"></a>In the simple case&mdash;if standard method combination is used and all
applicable methods are primary methods&mdash;the
effective method is the most specific method. 
That method can call the next most specific
method by using the <i>function</i> <code>call-next-method</code>.  The method that
<code>call-next-method</code> will call is referred to as the
<a name="index-next-method-708"></a><dfn>next method</dfn>.  The predicate <code>next-method-p</code> tests whether a next
method exists.  If <code>call-next-method</code> is called and there is no
next most specific method, the generic function <code>no-next-method</code>
is invoked.

<p>In general, the effective method is some combination of the applicable
methods.  It is described by a <i>form</i> that contains calls to some or
all of the applicable methods, returns the value or values that will
be returned as the value or values of the generic function, and
optionally makes some of the methods accessible by means of
<code>call-next-method</code>.

<p>The role of each method in the effective method is determined by its
<i>qualifiers</i> and the specificity of the method.  A <i>qualifier</i>
serves to mark a method, and the meaning of a <i>qualifier</i> is
determined by the way that these marks are used by this step
of the procedure.  If an applicable method has an unrecognized
<i>qualifier</i>, this step signals an error and does not include that method
in the effective method.

<p>When standard method combination is used together with qualified methods,
the effective method is produced as described in <a href="StdMethComb.html#StdMethComb">Section 7.6.6.2 (Standard Method Combination)</a>.

<p>Another type of method combination can be specified by using the
<tt>:method-combination</tt> option of <code>defgeneric</code> or
of any of the other operators that specify generic function options.  In
this way this step of the procedure can be customized.

<p>New types of method combination can be defined by using
the <code>define-method-combination</code> <i>macro</i>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">7.6.6.2 Standard Method Combination</h5>

<p><a name="StdMethComb"></a><a name="index-standard-709"></a>
Standard method combination is supported by the <i>class</i> <code>standard-generic-function</code>. 
It is used if no other type of method
combination is specified or if the built-in method combination type
<tt>standard</tt> is specified.

<p>Primary methods define the main action of the effective method,
while auxiliary methods modify that action in one of three ways. 
A primary method has no method <i>qualifiers</i>.

<p>An auxiliary method is a method whose
<i>qualifier</i> is <tt>:before</tt>, <tt>:after</tt>, or <tt>:around</tt>. 
Standard method combination
allows no more than one <i>qualifier</i> per method; if a method definition
specifies more than one <i>qualifier</i> per method, an error is signaled.

     <ul>
<li>A <i>before method</i> has the keyword <tt>:before</tt> as its only <i>qualifier</i>. 
A <i>before method</i> specifies <i>code</i> that is to be run before any
<i>primary methods</i>.

     <li>An <i>after method</i> has the keyword <tt>:after</tt> as its only <i>qualifier</i>. 
An <i>after method</i> specifies <i>code</i> that is to be run after
<i>primary methods</i>.

     <li>An <i>around method</i> has the keyword <tt>:around</tt> as its only <i>qualifier</i>. 
An <i>around method</i> specifies <i>code</i> that is to be run instead of other
<i>applicable methods</i>,
but which might contain explicit <i>code</i>
which calls some of those <i>shadowed</i> <i>methods</i>
(via <code>call-next-method</code>). 
</ul>

<p>The semantics of standard method combination is as follows:

     <ul>
<li>If there are any <i>around methods</i>, the most specific
<i>around method</i> is called.  It supplies the value or values of the
generic function.

     <li>Inside the body of an <i>around method</i>,
<code>call-next-method</code> can be used to call the <i>next method</i>.  When the next
method returns, the <i>around method</i> can execute more code,
perhaps based on the returned value or values. 
The <i>generic function</i> <code>no-next-method</code> is invoked if <code>call-next-method</code> is used and
there is no <i>applicable method</i> to call.  The <i>function</i> <code>next-method-p</code>
may be used to determine whether a <i>next method</i> exists.

     <li>If an <i>around method</i> invokes <code>call-next-method</code>,
the next most specific <i>around method</i>
is called, if one is applicable.  If there are no <i>around methods</i>
or if <code>call-next-method</code> is called by the least
specific <i>around method</i>, the other methods are called as
follows:

          <ul>
<li>All the <i>before methods</i> are called, in
most-specific-first order.  Their values are ignored. 
An error is signaled if <code>call-next-method</code> is used in a
<i>before method</i>.

          <li>The most specific primary method is called.  Inside the
body of a primary method, <code>call-next-method</code> may be used to call
the next most specific primary method.  When that method returns, the
previous primary method can execute more code, perhaps based on the
returned value or values.  The generic function <code>no-next-method</code>
is invoked if <code>call-next-method</code> is used and there are no more
applicable primary methods.  The <i>function</i> <code>next-method-p</code> may be
used to determine whether a <i>next method</i> exists.  If <code>call-next-method</code>
is not used, only the most specific <i>primary method</i> is called.

          <li>All the <i>after methods</i> are called in
most-specific-last order.  Their values are ignored. 
An error is signaled if <code>call-next-method</code> is used in an
<i>after method</i>. 
</ul>

     <li>If no <i>around methods</i> were invoked, the most
specific primary method supplies the value or values returned by the
generic function.  The value or values returned by the invocation of
<code>call-next-method</code> in the least specific <i>around method</i> are
those returned by the most specific primary method. 
</ul>

<p>In standard method combination, if there is an applicable method
but no applicable primary method, an error is signaled.

<p>The <i>before methods</i> are run in most-specific-first order while
the <i>after methods</i> are run in least-specific-first order.  The
design rationale for this difference can be illustrated with an
example.  Suppose class C<sub>1</sub> modifies the behavior of its
superclass, C<sub>2</sub>, by adding <i>before methods</i> and <i>after methods</i>. 
Whether the behavior of the class C<sub>2</sub> is defined
directly by methods on C<sub>2</sub> or is inherited from its superclasses
does not affect the relative order of invocation of methods on
instances of the class C<sub>1</sub>.  Class C<sub>1</sub>'s
<i>before method</i> runs before all of class C<sub>2</sub>'s methods. 
Class C<sub>1</sub>'s <i>after method</i> runs after all of class C<sub>2</sub>'s methods.

<p>By contrast, all <i>around methods</i> run before any other methods
run.  Thus a less specific <i>around method</i> runs before a more
specific primary method.

<p>If only primary methods are used and if <code>call-next-method</code> is not
used, only the most specific method is invoked; that is, more specific
methods shadow more general ones.

<h5 class="subsubsection">7.6.6.3 Declarative Method Combination</h5>

<p>The macro <code>define-method-combination</code> defines new forms of method
combination.  It provides a mechanism for customizing the production
of the effective method. The default procedure for producing an
effective method is described in <a href="DeterminingtheEffectiveMethod.html#DeterminingtheEffectiveMethod">Section 7.6.6.1 (Determining the Effective Method)</a>. 
There are two forms of
<code>define-method-combination</code>.  The short form is a simple facility while
the long form is more powerful and more verbose.  The long form
resembles <code>defmacro</code> in that the body is an expression that
computes a Lisp form; it provides mechanisms for implementing
arbitrary control structures within method combination and for
arbitrary processing of method <i>qualifiers</i>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">7.6.6.4 Built-in Method Combination Types</h5>

<p><a name="BuiltInMethCombTypes"></a>The object system&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->provides a set of built-in method combination types.  To
specify that a generic function is to use one of these method
combination types, the name of the method combination type is given as
the argument to the <tt>:method-combination</tt> option to
<code>defgeneric</code> or to the <tt>:method-combination</tt> option to any of the
other operators that specify generic function options.

<p>The names of the built-in  method combination types are listed in the next figure. 
<a name="index-g_t_002b-710"></a><a name="index-and-711"></a><a name="index-append-712"></a><a name="index-list-713"></a><a name="index-max-714"></a><a name="index-min-715"></a><a name="index-nconc-716"></a><a name="index-or-717"></a><a name="index-progn-718"></a><a name="index-standard-719"></a>

<div class="float">
<a name="fig7_002e2"></a><p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<p><table summary="">

<br></td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>

<p><strong class="float-caption">Figure 7.2: Built-in Method Combination Types</strong></p></div>

<p>The semantics of the <tt>standard</tt> built-in method combination type is
described in <a href="StdMethComb.html#StdMethComb">Section 7.6.6.2 (Standard Method Combination)</a>.  The other
built-in method combination types are called simple built-in method
combination types.

<p>The simple built-in method combination types act as though they were
defined by the short form of <code>define-method-combination</code>. 
They recognize two roles for <i>methods</i>:

     <ul>
<li>An <i>around method</i> has the keyword symbol
<tt>:around</tt> as its sole <i>qualifier</i>.  The meaning of
<tt>:around</tt> <i>methods</i> is the same as in standard method combination. 
Use of the functions <code>call-next-method</code> and <code>next-method-p</code>
is supported in <i>around methods</i>.

     <li>A primary method has the name of the method combination
type as its sole <i>qualifier</i>.  For example, the built-in method
combination type <code>and</code> recognizes methods whose sole <i>qualifier</i> is
<code>and</code>; these are primary methods. Use of the functions
<code>call-next-method</code> and <code>next-method-p</code> is not supported
in <i>primary methods</i>. 
</ul>

<p>The semantics of the simple built-in method combination types is as
follows:

     <ul>
<li>If there are any <i>around methods</i>, the most specific <i>around method</i>
is called.   It supplies the value or values of the <i>generic function</i>.

     <li>Inside the body of an <i>around method</i>, the function
<code>call-next-method</code> can be used to call the <i>next method</i>. 
The <i>generic function</i> <code>no-next-method</code> is invoked if
<code>call-next-method</code> is used and there is no applicable method to call. 
The <i>function</i> <code>next-method-p</code> may be used to determine whether a
<i>next method</i> exists. When the <i>next method</i> returns,
the <i>around method</i> can execute more code,
perhaps based on the returned value or values.

     <li>If an <i>around method</i> invokes <code>call-next-method</code>,
the next most specific <i>around method</i> is
called, if one is applicable.  If there are no <i>around methods</i>
or if <code>call-next-method</code> is called by the least specific
<i>around method</i>, a Lisp form derived from the name of the built-in
method combination type and from the list of applicable primary
methods is evaluated to produce the value of the generic function. 
Suppose the name of the method combination type is <i>operator</i>
and the call to the generic function is of the form

     <blockquote>
(<i>generic-function</i><!-- /@w -->&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->a<sub>1</sub><small class="dots">...</small> a<sub>n</sub>)
</blockquote>

     <li>Let M<sub>1</sub>,<small class="dots">...</small>,M<sub>k</sub> be the applicable primary methods
in order; then the derived Lisp form is

     <blockquote>
(<i>operator</i><!-- /@w -->&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->〈 M<sub>1</sub>

     <p>&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->a<sub>1</sub><small class="dots">...</small> a<sub>n</sub>〉<small class="dots">...</small>〈
M<sub>k</sub>&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->a<sub>1</sub><small class="dots">...</small> a<sub>n</sub>〉)
</blockquote>

     <li>If the expression 〈 M<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->a<sub>1</sub><small class="dots">...</small> a<sub>n</sub>〉 is
evaluated, the method M<sub>i</sub> will be applied to the arguments
a<sub>1</sub><small class="dots">...</small> a<sub>n</sub>. 
For example,
if <i>operator</i> is <code>or</code>,
the expression 〈 M<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->a<sub>1</sub><small class="dots">...</small> a<sub>n</sub>〉 is
evaluated only if 〈 M<sub>j</sub>&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->a<sub>1</sub><small class="dots">...</small> a<sub>n</sub>〉,
1≤ j&lt;i, returned <code>nil</code>.

     <li>The default order for the primary methods is
<tt>:most-specific-first</tt>.  However, the order can be reversed by supplying
<tt>:most-specific-last</tt> as the second argument to the <tt>:method-combination</tt> option. 
</ul>

<p>The simple built-in method combination types require exactly one
<i>qualifier</i> per method.  An error is signaled if there are applicable
methods with no <i>qualifiers</i> or with <i>qualifiers</i> that are not supported
by the method combination type. An error is signaled if there are
applicable <i>around methods</i> and no applicable primary
methods.
